Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?"],"metadata":{"id":"REGGMgG4htpD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Functions allow you to reuse code, make your programs modular, and simplify complex operations by breaking them down into smaller tasks. This improves readability, reduces redundancy, and makes debugging easier."],"metadata":{"id":"YDEGfCy3iDqC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. When does the code in a function run: when it’s specified or when it’s called?"],"metadata":{"id":"V-9WkpHoiFls"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The code in a function runs when the function is called, not when it's defined."],"metadata":{"id":"gZ7wIzW2iHpM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.

How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?"],"metadata":{"id":"HUpeCYa6iVzS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There is one global scope in a Python program.

Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?"],"metadata":{"id":"R8MC4ZekiedY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A return value is the output of a function that is passed back to the caller when the function completes. Yes, a return value can be part of an expression, allowing the result of the function to be used in further operations."],"metadata":{"id":"S_ktUmddigmn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8.
